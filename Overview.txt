Question 1: I downloaded the data and used R packages to change the data format, to filter the data effectively and to calculate the proportion from mobile/tablet devices. I then plotted the results as a line chart. The answer to question 1 prints to the console.

Question 2: I calculated the mean and filtered out the data greater than the mean, which I then wrote to file.

This task could have been done using different tools â€“ even non coding ones like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

The reason I chose to use R was for my own benefit as its the language I am most comfortable using for data analysis. Its best to do in code because it makes it very reproducible and I feel is R is easy to follow for a neophyte. 

If the purpose of writing this tool is for my colleagues to use I would have probably used another language like Javascript and built it into a webpage or app. I used bbplot to style the chart after hearing BBC News journalist talking about the tool at a recent event.
